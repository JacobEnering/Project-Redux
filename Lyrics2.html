        <h3 class="text-white Headed">Da Coconut Nut lyrics by Smokey Mountian---</h3>
        <p>The coconut nut is a giant nut<br>
        If you eat too much, you'll get very fat<br>
        Now, the coconut nut is a big, big nut<br>
        But it's delicious nut is not a nut<br>
        It's the coco fruit (it's the coco fruit)<br>
        Of the coco tree (of the coco tree)<br>
        From the coco palm family<br>
        There are so many uses of the coconut tree<br>
        You can build a bigger house for the family<br>
        All you need is to find a coconut man<br>
        If he cuts the tree, he gets the fruit free<br>
        It's the coco fruit (it's the coco fruit)<br>
        Of the coco tree (of the coco tree)<br>
        From the coco palm family<br>
        The coconut bark for the kitchen floor<br>
        If you save some of it, you can build the door<br>
        Now, the coconut trunk, do not throw this junk<br>
        If you save some of it, you'll have the second floor<br>
        The coconut wood is very good<br>
        It can stand 20 years if you pray it would<br>
        Now, the coconut root, to tell you the truth<br>
        You can throw it or use it as firewood<br>
        The coconut leaves good shade it gives<br>
        For the roof, for the walls up against the eaves<br>
        Now, the coconut fruit, say my relatives<br>
        Make good cannonballs up against the eaves<br>
        It's the coco fruit (it's the coco fruit)<br>
        Of the coco tree (of the coco tree)<br>
        From the coco palm family<br>
        The coconut nut is a giant nut<br>
        If you eat too much, you'll get very fat<br>
        Now, the coconut nut is a big, big nut<br>
        But it's delicious nut is not a nut<br>
        The coconut nut is a giant nut<br>

        But it's delicious nut is not a nut<br>
